# Download

The latest version of Secret Rabbit Code is {{ site.version }}.

Download it on [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/libsndfile/libsamplerate/releases/latest).

Compiling libsamplerate is relatively easy. The INSTALL file in the top level
directory gives instructions on compiling and installing libsamplerate on
Unix-like systems (including MacOSX). For Win32 there are instructions in the
docs/ directory of the tarball. These instructions are mirrored
[here](win32.md).
