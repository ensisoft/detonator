## Getting Started üëà

> [!TIP]
> If you're new to software development I suggest you immediately give up 
> and look for a better, saner, less frustrating career. If you're still
> foolish and stubborn enough to actually try to work with modern software, 
> tools, technologies and stacks then proceed but remember to keep the blood
> pressure pills nearby. This TRASH is always producing useless busy work
> that has NO meaning or value, only pain and frustration.
> Don't say I did not warn you!

> [!TIP]
> The build process assumes some familiarity with building C++ based projects using
> toolchains and tools such as GCC, MSVS, Emscriptenüí© and CMake. Combined these
> tools are total utter garbage and if you ever get stuff to build 6 months later
> something has changed and it's broken again.

> [!WARNING]
> You'll need to Qt5 in order to build the Editor. Qt company uses dark patterns 
> to try to trick you to purchase the paid version. Be careful!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> CMake 4x is not supported but you MUST have CMake 3.x
> A known working CMake version is 3.31.6. These fools always break this.
> A common characteristics of a solid good quality tool is that it *just works*. 
> CMake isn't it. 

### Build Steps:
1. First build the engine and editor for your target platform.
2. If you want to deploy / package your game for web then build the engine for HTML5/WASM
3. If you want to work on the engine itself it's advisory to also run the (unit) tests.


## Step 1) Building the Editor & Engine for Desktop Windows ü™ü

<strong>These build instructions are for 'MSVS 2022 Community Edition'</strong>

<details><summary>How to install dependencies</summary>

- Install Git version control system<br>
  https://git-scm.com/download/win


- Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Community<br>
  https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/
 

- Install prebuilt Qt 5.15.2<br>
  The Qt Company no longer offers an offline installer but rather force you to 
  use their shitty Online installer that requires an account with them.
  https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer-oss


- Install Conan package manager (VERSION 2)<br>
  https://github.com/conan-io/conan/releases/tag/2.19.1
  
 On first start you will likely need to generate a new conan profile:
```
  $ where conan 
  $ c:\Users\samiv\AppData\LocalData\Conan\conan.exe
  $ conan --version
  $ Conan version 2.19.1
  $ conan profile detect
```  

Open the profile file in `c:\Users\username\.conan2\profile\default` and make sure that
`compiler.cppstd` is set to `17`.

  ```
  [settings]
  arch=x86_64
  build_type=Release
  compiler=msvc
  compiler.cppstd=17
  compiler.runtime=dynamic
  compiler.version=194
  os=Windows
  ```

- Install CMake build tool<br>
  These fools have broken something and CMake 4x doesn't work so make sure to use CMake 3x instead. 
- Below is a direct link which I expect will be invalid by the time you read this.<br>
  https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.31.8/cmake-3.31.8-windows-x86_64.msi

  
- Install Python 3.13.x üí©üí©<br>
  Make sure that you check "Add Python to PATH" option when installing.<br>
  https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.5/python-3.13.5-amd64.exe

  ```
  $ where python
  $ C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Python.exe
  $ python --version
  $ Python 3.13.5
  ```

</details>

## Step 1) Building the Editor & Engine for Desktop Linux üêß

<details><summary>How to install dependencies</summary>

*See your distro manuals for how to install the packages.*

Install these packages:

- GCC (or Clang) compiler suite
- CMake build tool
- Conanüí©üí© package manager (VERSION 2)
  - On Archlinux you can use 'yay' to install conan + its dependencies from AUR*
  - See below for installing yay + conanüí©üí©
- Git version control system
- Qt5 application framework

</details>

<details><summary>How to build the project in RELEASE</summary>

```
  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/detonator
  $ cd detonator
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ conan install .. --output-folder=conan --build missing
  $ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=conan/conan_toolchain.cmake
  $ make -j16 install
  $ ctest -j16
```
</details>

<details><summary>How to build the project in DEBUG [OPTIONAL]</summary>

```
  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/detonator
  $ cd detonator
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
  $ mkdir build_d
  $ cd build_d
  $ conan install .. --output-folder=conan --build missing -s build_type=Debug
  $ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=conan/conan_toolchain.cmake
  $ make -j16 install
  $ ctest -j16
```
</details>

<details><summary>How to build the project in PROFILE [OPTIONAL] </summary>

- Build the project for profiling using Valgrind / KCachegrind
```
  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/detonator
  $ cd detonator
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
  $ mkdir build_profile
  $ cd build_profile
  $ conan install .. --output-folder=conan --build missing -s build_type=RelWithDebInfo
  $ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=conan/conan_toolchain.cmake
  $ make -j16 install
```
- Then in order to profile and analyze the output use the combination of valgrind and kcachegrind.
  For example:
```
  $ cd detonator/audio/test/
  $ valgrind --tool=callgrind ./audio_test --graph
  $ kcachegrind callgrind.out.XXXXX
```
</details>

<details><summary>How to build with Ninja, Clang and Mold linker [OPTIONAL]</summary>

- These are alternative instructions for build using Ninja, Clang and Mold linker.

```
  $ export CC=/usr/bin/clang
  $ export CXX=/usr/bin/clang++
  $ conan profile new detonator-clang --detect

  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/detonator
  $ cd detonator
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ conan install .. --build missing --profile detonator-clang
  $ cmake -G "Ninja" .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_MOLD_LINKER=ON
  $ ninja -j16 install
```
</details>

<details><summary>How to build Qt5 designer plugin [OPTIONAL]</summary>

```
  $ cd detonator/editor/gui/qt
  $ mkdir build
  $ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  $ make -j16
  $ sudo make install
```

</details>

<details><summary>Build troubleshooting üí©</summary>

When you create a Conan profile with

```
$ conan profile new default --detect
```

If Conan complains about "ERROR: invalid setting" (for example when GCC major version changes)
you can try edit ~/.conan/settings.yaml. Search for the GCC versions and edit there.

</details>

## Step 2) Building the Engine for HTML5/WASM üí©

> [!NOTE]
> HTML5/WASM build is only required if you want to build and package  your game for the web.<br>
> If you just want to try the editor or build native games you don't need this.

<br>
Some notes about building to HTML5/WASM.

* Building to HTML5/WASM is currently supported only for the engine but not the editor.
* Current Emscriptenüí© version is 3.1.50. Using other version will likely break things.
* Building to HTML5/WASM will produce the required JS and WASM files to run games in the browser,<br>
  but you still need to build the editor in order to develop the game and package it.<br>
* When you package your game with the editor, the HTML5/WASM game files are copied by the editor<br>
  during the packaging process in order to produce the final deployable game package.

<details><summary>How to build on Linux üêß</summary>

- Install Emscriptenüí©
```
  $ cd detonator
  $ git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
  $ cd emsdk
  $ git pull
  $ ./emsdk install 3.1.50
  $ ./emsdk activate 3.1.50
  $ source ./emsdk_env.sh
```
- Check your Emscriptenüí© installation
```
  $ which emcc
  $ /home/user/emsdk/upstream/emscripten/emcc
  $ emcc --version
  $ emcc (Emscripten gcc/clang-like replacement + linker emulating GNU ld) 3.1.50 (047b82506d6b471873300a5e4d1e690420b582d0)
```
- Build the DETONATOR 2D engine into a WASM blob. Make sure that you have the Emscriptenüí© tools in your path,
  i.e. you have sourced emsdk_env.sh in your current shell.
```
  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/detonator
  $ cd detonator
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
  $ cd emscripten
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ emcmake cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  $ make -j16 install
```
</details>

<details><summary>How to build on Windows ü™ü</summary>

- Install Ninjaü•∑ build tool https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases

  Drop the ninja.exe for example into the emsdk/ folder or anywhere on your PATH.


- Install Emscriptenüí©
```
  $ cd detonator
  $ git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
  $ cd emsdk
  $ git pull
  $ emsdk.bat install 3.1.50
  $ emsdk.bat activate 3.1.50
  $ emsdk_env.bat
```
- Check your Emscriptenüí© and Ninjaü•∑ installation
```
  $ where emcc
  $ C:\coding\detonator\emsdk\upstream\emscripten\emcc
  $ C:\coding\detonator\emsdk\upstream\emscripten\emcc.bat
  $ emcc --version
  $ emcc (Emscripten gcc/clang-like replacement + linker emulating GNU ld) 3.1.50 (047b82506d6b471873300a5e4d1e690420b582d0)
  $ where ninja
  $ C:\coding\detonator\emsdk\ninja.exe
  $ ninja --version
  $ 1.10.2
```
- Build the DETONATOR 2D engine into a WASM blob. Make sure you have emcc and Ninja in your path i.e. you have
  ran emsdk_env.bat in your current shell.
```
  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/detonator
  $ cd detonator
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
  $ cd emscripten
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ emcmake cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  $ ninja -j16
  $ ninja -j16 install
```

```

 * https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/15958
 * Current fix is to upgrade to Emscriptenüí© 3.1.10

Build fails with
```
wasm-ld: error: --shared-memory is disallowed by ldo.c.o because it was not compiled with 'atomics' or 'bulk-memory' features.
```

 * https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk/issues/790
 * This is trying to communicate that something was built without thread support when thread support should be enabled.<br>
   In other words trying to mix + match translation units / libs built with different build configuration.
 * Make sure to double check the build flags including `third_party/CMakeLists.txt`

</details>

If your build was successful there should now be `GameEngine.js`, `GameEngine.wasm` and `GameEngine.worker.js` files in the editor's `dist` folder.<br>

### Step 2.1) Deploying the Game for the Web üí©

When you package your game for the web the editor will copy all the required files to your chosen output directory.

* GameEngine.js
* GameEngine.wasm
* GameEngine.worker.js
* FILESYSTEM
* FILESYSTEM.js
* game.html

These 6 files are then all the files that you need to deploy/copy over to your web server.<br><br>

> [!TIP]<br>
> You can rename `game.html` to whatever you want, for example  `my-amazing-game.html`. Just don't change the names of any other files


<details><summary>1. Configure Your Web Server</summary>

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]<br>
> You must enable the correct web policiesüí© in order to enable SharedArrayBufferüí© in order to enable threads !! üí©üí©<br>
> Without SharedArrayBuffer web worker threads can't run and the engine cannot work. üí©üí©<br>
> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer


> [!IMPORTANT]<br>
> You must set the HTTP `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` to `same-origin`<br>
> You must set the HTTP `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` to `require-corp`<br>
> You can achieve this with a `.htaccess` file.<br>

```
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin  "https://your-domain.com"
Header set Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy "require-corp"
Header set Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy "same-site"
Header set Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy   "same-origin"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "range"
```

</details>

<details><summary>2. Deploy Your Game to Your Web Server</summary>

<br>

Copy the following files to your webserver using `sftp`or similar mechanism.<br>
You'll find these in your package output folder after the successful completion of your game packaging
in the editor.

```
  $ sftp my-user@my-server.com
  $ cd www\my-game\
  $ put GameEngine.js
  $ put GameEngine.wasm
  $ put GameEngine.worker.js
  $ put FILESYSTEM
  $ put FILESYSTEM.js
  $ put game.html
```

</details>


## Step 3) Running (Unit) Tests ü´£

<details><summary>Instructions to run unit tests</summary>

There's a bunch of unit tests that are built as part of the normal build process. Basically anything that begins with
a "*unit_test_*" is a unit test.<br>
For writing tests there's a very simple testing utility that is available in base. [base/test_minimal.h](base/test_minimal.h)

In addition to having the unit tests both the audio and graphics subsystems also have "rendering" tests, i.e. playing audio
or rendering stuff on the screen. The rendering tests rely on a set of *gold images* a.k.a. known good images.
Currently, the images are provided as part of this repository but there's the problem that because of differences
in OpenGL implementations it's possible that the rendering output is not exactly the same between various
vendors/implementations (such as NVIDIA, AMD, Intel etc. Fixing this is a todo for later). The audio tests, however,
don't have any automated way of verifying the test output.

* The expectation is that all unit test cases should pass on Linux
* The graphics rendering tests might have false negatives on different OpenGL vendors/driver versions/OS.
* Any graphics rendering test that differs from the expected gold image will generate *delta* and *result* images.
  * The *result* image will be the actual result image.
  * The *delta* image will help visualize the pixels that were not the same between the *result* and the *gold* image.
* Using multiple CMake "jobs" to run tests can confuse the rendering tests. 
  * A safer alternative is to *NOT* use the -jN parameter but only use a single job.
* If you want to run a single unit test application simply run the executable but please mind the current working folder.
  * On Windows some tests can fail because of this!
  * unit_test_workspace.exe needs to run in `build\Release` folder.
  * unit_test_image.exe needs to run in `build` folder.

### On the Web (WASM+HTML5) üí©

> [!NOTE]<br>
> Currently, only some unit tests are available on the web. More tests will be enabled as needed.

<details><summary>How to run unit tests</summary>

After successful build the `detonator/emscripten/bin` folder should contain the following build artifacts:

  * http-server.py
  * unit-test.html
  * UnitTest.js
  * UnitTest.wasm
  * UnitTestThread.js
  * UnitTestThread.wasm
  * UnitTestThread.worker.js

1. Launch a web server for serving the test HTML pages.

```
  $ cd detonator/emscripten/bin
  $ python http-server.py
  $ Serving at port 8000
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/unit-test.html
3. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/unit-test-thread.html

The test execution may take some time. The performance tests will execute without running the JS main thread,
thus the page will seem "stuck" to the browser. But if you let it run it should complete and print `Success!`
to indicate completion.
