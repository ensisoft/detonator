## Getting Started üëà
1. First build the engine and editor for your target platform.
2. If you want to deploy / package your game for web then build the engine for HTML5/WASM
3. If you want to work on the engine itself it's advisory to also run the (unit) tests.

<i>
<strong>The build process assumes some familiarity with building C++ based projects using
toolchains and tools such as GCC or MSVS and CMake.<br>

You'll need to have Qt5 in order to build the Editor. If you're using Linux you can get Qt from your distributions repositories.
<br>If you're using Windows you'll need to download a prebuilt Qt5 package (installer) from the Qt Company's website.<br>
You can try the link below. If that doesn't work  you'll need an account with the Qt Company

</details>


<details><summary>How to build the project in RELEASE</summary>

- Open "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019"

```
  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/detonator
  $ cd detonator
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build

```

</details>

<details><summary>How to build the project in DEBUG [OPTIONAL]</summary>

_Note that on MSVS the library interfaces change between debug/release build configs. (e.g. iterator debug levels).
This means that in order to link to 3rd party libraries the debug versions of those libraries must be used._

- Open "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019"

```
  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/detonator
  $ cd detonator
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
  $ mkdir build_d
  $ cd build_d
  $ conan install .. --output-folder=conan --build missing -s build_type=Debug
  $ cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=conan/conan_toolchain.cmake
  $ cmake --build   . --config Debug
  $ cmake --install . --config Debug
```

</details>

<details><summary>How to build Qt5 designer plugin [OPTIONAL]</summary>

```
  $ cd editor\gui\qt
  $ mkdir build
  $ cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -DCMAKE-BUILD_TYPE=Release
  $ cmake --build . --config Release
  $ cmake --install . --config Release
```

</details>



## Step 1) Building the Editor & Engine for Desktop Linux üêß

<details><summary>How to install dependencies</summary>

*See your distro manuals for how to install the packages.*

Install these packages:

- GCC (or Clang) compiler suite
- CMake build tool
- Conan package manager (VERSION 2)
  - On Archlinux you can use 'yay' to install conan + its dependencies from AUR*
- Git version control system
- Qt5 application framework

</details>

<details><summary>How to build the project in RELEASE</summary>

```
  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/detonator
  $ cd detonator
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ conan install .. --output-folder=conan --build missing
  $ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=conan/conan_toolchain.cmake
  $ make -j16 install
  $ ctest -j16
```
</details>

<details><summary>How to build the project in DEBUG [OPTIONAL]</summary>

```
  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/detonator
  $ cd detonator
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
  $ mkdir build_d
  $ cd build_d
  $ conan install .. --output-folder=conan --build missing -s build_type=Debug
  $ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=conan/conan_toolchain.cmake
  $ make -j16 install
  $ ctest -j16
```
</details>

<details><summary>How to build the project in PROFILE [OPTIONAL] </summary>

- Build the project for profiling using Valgrind / KCachegrind
```
  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/detonator
  $ cd detonator
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
  $ mkdir build_profile
  $ cd build_profile
  $ conan install .. --output-folder=conan --build missing -s build_type=RelWithDebInfo
  $ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=conan/conan_toolchain.cmake
  $ make -j16 install
```
- Then in order to profile and analyze the output use the combination of valgrind and kcachegrind.
  For example:
```
  $ cd detonator/audio/test/
  $ valgrind --tool=cachegrind ./audio_test --graph
  $ kcaghegrind cachegrind.out.XXXXX
```
</details>

<details><summary>How to build with Ninja, Clang and Mold linker [OPTIONAL]</summary>

- These are alternative instructions for build using Ninja, Clang and Mold linker.

```
  $ export CC=/usr/bin/clang
  $ export CXX=/usr/bin/clang++
  $ conan profile new detonator-clang --detect

  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/detonator
  $ cd detonator
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ conan install .. --build missing --profile detonator-clang
  $ cmake -G "Ninja" .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_MOLD_LINKER=ON
  $ ninja -j16 install
```
</details>

<details><summary>How to build Qt5 designer plugin [OPTIONAL]</summary>

```
  $ cd detonator/editor/gui/qt
  $ mkdir build
  $ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  $ make -j16
  $ sudo make install
```

</details>

<details><summary>Build troubleshooting</summary>

When you create a Conan profile with

```
$ conan profile new default --detect
```

If Conan complains about "ERROR: invalid setting" (for example when GCC major version changes)
you can try edit ~/.conan/settings.yaml. Search for the GCC versions and edit there.

</details>



## Step 2) Building the Engine for HTML5/WASM üåê

<strong>
<i>HTML5/WASM build is only required if you want to build and package  your game for the web.<br>
If you just want to try the editor or build native games you don't need this.
</i>
</strong>
<br><br>
Some notes about building to HTML5/WASM.

* Building to HTML5/WASM is currently supported only for the engine but not the editor.
* Current Emscripten version is 3.0.0. Using other version will likely break things.
* Building to HTML5/WASM will produce the required JS and WASM files to run games in the browser,<br>
  but you still need to build the editor in order to develop the game and package it.<br>
  When you package your game through the editor, the HTML5/WASM game files are copied by the editor<br>
  during the packaging process in order to produce the final deployable game package.

<details><summary>How to build on Linux</summary>

- Install Emscripten
```
  $ cd detonator
  $ git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
  $ cd emsdk
  $ git pull
  $ ./emsdk install latest
  $ ./emsdk activate 3.0.0
  $ source ./emsdk_env.sh
```
- Check your Emscripten installation
```
  $ which emcc
  $ /home/user/emsdk/upstream/emscripten/emcc
  $ emcc --version
  $ emcc (Emscripten gcc/clang-like replacement + linker emulating GNU ld) 3.0.0 (3fd52e107187b8a169bb04a02b9f982c8a075205)
```
- Build the DETONATOR 2D engine into a WASM blob. Make sure that you have the emscripten tools in your path,
  i.e. you have sourced emsdk_env.sh in your current shell.
```
  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/detonator
  $ cd detonator
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
  $ cd emscripten
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ emcmake cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  $ make -j16 install
```
</details>

<details><summary>How to build on Windows</summary>

- Install Ninja built tool https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases

  Drop the ninja.exe for example into the emsdk/ folder or anywhere on your PATH.


- Install Emscripten
```
  $ cd detonator
  $ git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
  $ cd emsdk
  $ git pull
  $ emsdk.bat install latest
  $ emsdk.bat activate 3.0.0
  $ emsdk_env.bat
```
- Check your Emscripten and Ninja installation
```
  $ where emcc
  $ C:\coding\detonator\emsdk\upstream\emscripten\emcc
  $ C:\coding\detonator\emsdk\upstream\emscripten\emcc.bat
  $ emcc --version
  $ emcc (Emscripten gcc/clang-like replacement + linker emulating GNU ld) 3.0.0 (3fd52e107187b8a169bb04a02b9f982c8a075205)
  $ where ninja
  $ C:\coding\detonator\emsdk\ninja.exe
  $ ninja --version
  $ 1.10.2
```
- Build the DETONATOR 2D engine into a WASM blob. Make sure you have emcc and Ninja in your path i.e. you have
  ran emsdk_env.bat in your current shell.
```
  $ git clone https://github.com/ensisoft/detonator
  $ cd detonator
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
  $ cd emscripten
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ emcmake cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  $ ninja -j16
  $ ninja -j16 install
```
</details>

If everything went well there should now be `GameEngine.js`, `GameEngine.wasm` and `GameEngine.worker.js` files in the editor's dist folder.<br>
The .js file contains the JavaScript glue code needed to manhandle the WASM code into the browser's WASM engine when the web page loads.<br>
When a game is packaged for web these files will then be deployed (copied) into the game's output directory.

<details><summary>Deploying your game on the web [MUST DO]</summary>
<br>
<i>
<strong>You must enable the correct web policies in order to support SharedArrayBuffer in order to enable threads !!</strong><br>
Without SharedArrayBuffer Web worker threads can't run and the engine cannot work.
</i>ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨

When you're ready to publish your game and want to upload it to your web server you must turn on `HTTP Cross-Origin`
policy flags in order to enable `SharedArrayBuffer`.
<br> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer

You can achieve this with a .htaccess file.

```
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin  "https://your-domain.com"
Header set Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy "require-corp"
Header set Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy "same-site"
Header set Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy   "same-origin"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "range"
```

Copy the following files to your webserver using `sftp`or similar mechanism.<br>
You'll find these in your package output folder after the successful completion of your game packaging
in the editor.

```
  $ ssh my-user@my-server.com
  $ cd www\my-game\
  $ put GameEngine.js
  $ put GameEngine.wasm
  $ put GameEngine.worker.js
  $ put FILESYSTEM
  $ put FILESYSTEM.js
  $ put game.html
```

## Step 3) Running (Unit) Tests ü´£

<details><summary>Instructions to run unit tests</summary>

There's a bunch of unit tests that are built as part of the normal build process. Basically anything that begins with
a "*unit_test_*" is a unit test.
For writing tests there's a very simple testing utility that is available in base. [base/test_minimal.h](base/test_minimal.h)

In addition to having the unit tests both the audio and graphics subsystems also have "rendering" tests, i.e. playing audio
or rendering stuff on the screen. The rendering tests rely on a set of *gold images* a.k.a. known good images.
Currently, the images are provided as part of this repository but there's the problem that because of differences
in OpenGL implementations it's possible that the rendering output is not exactly the same between various
vendors/implementations (such as NVIDIA, AMD, Intel etc. Fixing this is a todo for later). The audio tests, however,
don't have any automated way of verifying the test output.

#### [See this list for known Issues](ISSUES.md)

### On the desktop (Linux/Windows)

<details><summary>How to run all tests</summary>

*Currently, the expectation is that all cases should pass on Linux. On Windows some tests are unfortunately broken.*
* In order to run tests after a successful build:

```
  $ cd detonator/build
  $ ctest -j16
```
</details>

<details><summary>How to run audio tests</summary>

* Runs, mp3, ogg, flag and 24bit .wav tests. Use --help for more information.
```
  $ cd detonator/audio/test
  $ ./audio_test --mp3 --ogg --flac --24bit
  $ ...
  $ ./audio_test --help
```

</details>

<details><summary>How to run graphics tests</summary>

*Any test rendering that differs from the expected gold image will stop the program for user input
(press any key to continue) and will generate a *Delta_* and *Result_* images. The former will help visualize the pixels
that were not the same between result and gold and the result will be actual rendering result.*

* Run all tests with MSAA4. Use --help for more information

```
  $ cd detonator/graphics/test/dist
  $ ./graphics_test --test --msaa4
  $ ...
  $ ./graphics_test --help
```

</details>

### On the Web (WASM+HTML5)
*Currently, only some unit tests are available on the web. More tests will be enabled as needed.*

<details><summary>How to run unit tests</summary>

The detonator/emscripten/bin folder should contain the following build artifacts:
* unit-test.html
* UnitTest.js
* UnitTest.wasm

Launch a web server for serving the test HTML page.

```
  $ cd detonator/emscripten/bin
  $ python -m http.server
```

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/unit-test.html.
