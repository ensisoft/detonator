    <h2 id="file-resources">File Resources</h2>
    <p>When building game content it's normal to use resources created in other applications and stored somewhere else on your
    computer. Examples of these resources are font files (.ttf, .otf), texture files (.png, .bmp, .jpe?g) and shader (.glsl)
    files. For example you might use some image editor to create your textures or you might have downloaded them from some
    site such as <a href="http://www.opengameart.org">http://www.opengameart.org</a>.
    Regardless these are normally found somewhere on your computer's hard drive.</p>
    <p>Unlike some other tools Gamestudio does *not* have an import step that would copy the files into your project tree.
    Rather it allows you to use these files from whichever location they have. In other words Gamestudio only stores the path
    to the resources in its own project files. When the project/workspace content is packaged the resources are all gathered
    and packaged and then finally copied into the designated output folder.</p>
    <p>What does this mean to you?
        <ol>
        <li>If you're only working on your game yourself on a single machine you can place your game resources wherever you wish
            and any time you update your resource files the changes are reflected in your game project without any need to "reimport".
            (Just reload your textures and/or shaders).</li>
        <li>However if you want to be able to share your game project with other people you must store your resource files in a
            location that is universally available on every single machine.</li>
    </ol>
    The simplest way is to simply place your resource files under your workspace directory. For example:
    <br>
    mygame/textures/player/texture0.png<br>
    mygame/textures/player/texture1.png<br>
    ...<br>
    mygame/content.json<br>
    mygame/workspace.json<br>
    <br>
    When a resource that is stored under the workspace is added to the project/workspace the path is always stored relative
    to the workspace itself. This makes the whole workspace self contained and portable across machines.
    You can then additionally add your whole game project directory into some version control tool such as Git.</p>
