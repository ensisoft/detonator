{
    // Graphical projections can be classified as follows:
    //
    // - Perspective projection (aka linear projection)
    //    - normally the projection ray through the center of the projection plane
    //      is perpendicular to the plane but it doesn't have to be.
    //
    //  - Parallel projection.
    //    In parallel projection the projection rays are all parallel. I.e. they all point at
    //    at the same direction from the projection plane. The angle of each vector wrt the
    //    projection plane can be perpendicular (orthographic projection) or at some angle (oblique projection)
    //
    //    - Orthographic projection.
    //        In orthogonal all projection rays are parallel *and* perpendicular to the projection plane.
    //        Depending on the view angles this projection can further be split into:
    //        - "Plan" or "Elevation" projection. The view is directly aligned (projection rays are
    //          parallel to one axis) which shortens one axis away when projected. The two remaining projected
    //          axis are at 90 degree angle.
    //       - Axonometric projections. The view is at some angle that lets all 3 (x,y,z) axis be projected onto
    //         the projection plane at various projection angles (i.e. the angles of the axis after projection).
    //         - Isometric projection.
    //            Angles between all projected axis vectors is 120 degrees. 1.732:1 pixel ratio.
    //         - Dimetric projection
    //            Two angles between projected vectors are 105 degrees and the third angle is 150.
    //             This creates a pixel ratio of 2:1 width:height. Tiles will be 2 as wide as they're
    //             high and lines parallel with the x, y rays in the coordinate grid move up/down 1 pixels
    //             for every 1 pixel horizontally (when projected)
    //         - Trimetric projection
    //            todo

    //    - Oblique projection.
    //        In oblique projection all projection rays are parallel but non perpendicular. In other words
    //        the projection rays are at slanted/skewed wrt the projection plane.
    //        - Military
    //        - Cavalier
    //        - Topdown
    //

    // High level perspective (view point, vantage point) defines how
    // game objects are displayed when rendered.
    // Each perspective requires a combination of a specific view/camera
    // vantage point and the right graphical projection in order to produce
    // the desired rendering. For example the dimetric perspective (typically
    // referred to as 'isometric' in 2D games) is a camera angle of 45 deg
    // around UP axis and 30 deg down tilt combined with orthographic projection.

    // Tile plane (both dimetric or axis aligned)
    // - Tiles are laid out on the XY plane which is then transformed with a model
    //   and camera transformation to a certain position relative to
    //   the camera. Along with an orthographic projection the objects are projected
    //   onto the projection plane with dimetric angles between the basis vectors.
    // - When using axis aligned tile plane the plane aligns completely with the
    //   scene plane even though it's conceptually different plane.

    // Scene plane
    // - Entities (and entity nodes) are laid out on this XY plane which is then
    //   transformed with a model and a camera transformation to a certain position
    //   relative to the camera.
    // - The scene plane is parallel to the orthographic projection plane.
    // - This 2d plane is the is axis aligned game plane of the underlying 3D space,
    //   in other words the game world takes place on this plane.
    //
    // Currently every vector in either space is assumed to live exactly on the
    // plane, i.e. there's no 3rd dimension (Z values are 0.0f).
    // Even though there are instances when the coordinate spaces align it's wise
    // to keep the conceptual distinction in mind and use the functions to map
    // vectors from one space to another. This should be more future proof when/if
    // another perspective is added.
    //
    // Finally there's the concept of a "world plane" or "game plane" which is
    // used when we don't really care about which plane it is that we're dealing
    // with. This is mostly useful for the editor to transform for example mouse
    // and window coordinates to a coordinate on some plane for placing objects.
    // In a tilemap editor the mouse is mapped to the tile plane which is either
    // the dimetric plane or the axis aligned plane and in the scene / entity
    // editors the plane is the xy plane.
